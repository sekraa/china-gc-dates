# China Travel Days Calculator for Green Card Applications

The China Travel Days Calculator is a Python program that analyzes how many days a person spends in or out of China for the past five years. The program takes input in the form of entry and exit dates from a CSV file and calculates the number of days spent in China for each of the five years before a specified application date. It provides three different scenarios for calculating the days spent in China based on the provided entry and exit dates.

This may be useful if someone likes to apply for a China Permanent Residence also know as China Green Card.
